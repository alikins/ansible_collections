# Ansible module: ansible.module_enos_config


Manage Lenovo ENOS configuration sections

## Description

Lenovo ENOS configurations use a simple block indent file syntax for segmenting configuration into sections.  This module provides an implementation for working with ENOS configuration sections in a deterministic way.

## Arguments

``` json
{
    "admin": "{'description': ['Enters into administration configuration mode for making config changes to the device.'], 'type': 'bool', 'default': False}",
    "after": "{'description': ['The ordered set of commands to append to the end of the command stack if a change needs to be made.  Just like with I(before) this allows the playbook designer to append a set of commands to be executed after the command set.']}",
    "auth_pass": "{'description': ['Specifies the password to use if required to enter privileged mode on the remote device.  If I(authorize) is false, then this argument does nothing. If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable C(ANSIBLE_NET_AUTH_PASS) will be used instead.']}",
    "authorize": "{'description': ['Instructs the module to enter privileged mode on the remote device before sending any commands.  If not specified, the device will attempt to execute all commands in non-privileged mode. If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable C(ANSIBLE_NET_AUTHORIZE) will be used instead.'], 'type': 'bool', 'default': False}",
    "backup": "{'description': ['This argument will cause the module to create a full backup of the current C(running-config) from the remote device before any changes are made.  The backup file is written to the C(backup) folder in the playbook root directory.  If the directory does not exist, it is created.'], 'type': 'bool', 'default': False}",
    "before": "{'description': ['The ordered set of commands to push on to the command stack if a change needs to be made.  This allows the playbook designer the opportunity to perform configuration commands prior to pushing any changes without affecting how the set of commands are matched against the system.']}",
    "comment": "{'description': ['Allows a commit description to be specified to be included when the configuration is committed.  If the configuration is not changed or committed, this argument is ignored.'], 'default': 'configured by enos_config'}",
    "config": "{'description': ['The module, by default, will connect to the remote device and retrieve the current running-config to use as a base for comparing against the contents of source.  There are times when it is not desirable to have the task get the current running-config for every task in a playbook.  The I(config) argument allows the implementer to pass in the configuration to use as the base config for comparison.']}",
    "lines": "{'description': ['The ordered set of commands that should be configured in the section.  The commands must be the exact same commands as found in the device running-config.  Be sure to note the configuration command syntax as some commands are automatically modified by the device config parser.'], 'aliases': ['commands']}",
    "match": "{'description': ['Instructs the module on the way to perform the matching of the set of commands against the current device config.  If match is set to I(line), commands are matched line by line.  If match is set to I(strict), command lines are matched with respect to position.  If match is set to I(exact), command lines must be an equal match.  Finally, if match is set to I(none), the module will not attempt to compare the source configuration with the running configuration on the remote device.'], 'default': 'line', 'choices': ['line', 'strict', 'exact', 'none']}",
    "parents": "{'description': ['The ordered set of parents that uniquely identify the section the commands should be checked against.  If the parents argument is omitted, the commands are checked against the set of top level or global commands.']}",
    "provider": "{'description': ['A dict object containing connection details.'], 'suboptions': {'host': {'description': ['Specifies the DNS host name or address for connecting to the remote device over the specified transport.  The value of host is used as the destination address for the transport.'], 'required': True}, 'port': {'description': ['Specifies the port to use when building the connection to the remote device.'], 'default': 22}, 'username': {'description': ['Configures the username to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device.  This value is used to authenticate the SSH session. If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable C(ANSIBLE_NET_USERNAME) will be used instead.']}, 'password': {'description': ['Specifies the password to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device.   This value is used to authenticate the SSH session. If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable C(ANSIBLE_NET_PASSWORD) will be used instead.']}, 'timeout': {'description': ['Specifies the timeout in seconds for communicating with the network device for either connecting or sending commands.  If the timeout is exceeded before the operation is completed, the module will error.'], 'default': 10}, 'ssh_keyfile': {'description': ['Specifies the SSH key to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device.   This value is the path to the key used to authenticate the SSH session. If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable C(ANSIBLE_NET_SSH_KEYFILE) will be used instead.']}, 'authorize': {'description': ['Instructs the module to enter privileged mode on the remote device before sending any commands.  If not specified, the device will attempt to execute all commands in non-privileged mode. If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable C(ANSIBLE_NET_AUTHORIZE) will be used instead.'], 'type': 'bool', 'default': 'no'}, 'auth_pass': {'description': ['Specifies the password to use if required to enter privileged mode on the remote device.  If I(authorize) is false, then this argument does nothing. If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable C(ANSIBLE_NET_AUTH_PASS) will be used instead.']}}}",
    "replace": "{'description': ['Instructs the module on the way to perform the configuration on the device.  If the replace argument is set to I(line) then the modified lines are pushed to the device in configuration mode.  If the replace argument is set to I(block) then the entire command block is pushed to the device in configuration mode if any line is not correct.'], 'default': 'line', 'choices': ['line', 'block', 'config']}",
    "src": "{'description': ['Specifies the source path to the file that contains the configuration or configuration template to load.  The path to the source file can either be the full path on the Ansible control host or a relative path from the playbook or role root directory.  This argument is mutually exclusive with I(lines), I(parents).']}",
}
```

## Examples
